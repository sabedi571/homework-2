This assignment taught me to use bootstrap for responsive layouts without the need for css file. 

I created a contact me, About and Portfolio pages using bootstrap components and utilities. Some of the components i used are mentioned below.

I used a Nav bar component to create a fixed navigation bar on top of each page to provide links. I also used Cards component to create a content container within my larger container. Lastly i used form-group component to create a horizontal box so you can enter name, email and a message.

Aside from bootstrap component i utilized the container and grid system for my portfolio.I assured everything is responsive for all screen sizes.
